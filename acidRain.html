        <p>The Black Triangle is an area that received heavy acid rain throughout the 1970s and 80s. In parts of the Black Triangle, entire forests were dead or dying and even railroad tracks were being corroded by the acidic precipitation.</p>
        <p>The emissions of coal-burning factories in Eastern Europe came under strict regulation by the Geneva Convention of 1979 to prevent further acid rain pollution, a measure that has been successful in significantly reducing acid deposition in the region.</p>
